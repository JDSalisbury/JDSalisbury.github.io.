<p width="100%"> Creating a web application to manage D&D Character sheets. Currently this is focused on creating characters for Gamma World 4th edition. The application randomly generates 3 character choices at a time by pulling 75 random classes/races together. You can then manage the character adding equipment skills and abilities as you increase in level.

## Pantry Plus

##### Food Pantry shopping cart application for curbside pickups

<br />

<p>Constructed a curb-side pick up application for The Broad St. Food Pantry. The Broad St. Food Pantry was unable to service some of there clients due to the hour long wait time. Our goal was to reduce the wait time to ten minutes so that people with children or people who dont have a secure form of transportion can quickly come in and get their food. Through TDD and Pair programing my team of six was able to get the wait time down to seven minutes. This application is currently in operation and is assisting 150+ patrons.

<p>Cat owner. It takes a lot to own one of these creatures. I've successfully kept this small beast alive for about a two years now. The struggle is real. She barely cares about me.</p>
