<p width="100%"> Creating a web application to manage D&D Character sheets. Currently this is focused on creating characters for Gamma World 4th edition. The application randomly generates 3 character choices at a time by pulling 75 random classes/races together. You can then manage the character adding equipment skills and abilities as you increase in level.

<br />

<ImageCarousel />

<p>Constructed a curb-side pick up application for The Broad St. Food Pantry. The Broad St. Food Pantry was unable to service some of there clients due to the hour long wait time. Our goal was to reduce the wait time to ten minutes so that people with children or people who dont have a secure form of transportion can quickly come in and get their food. Through TDD and Pair programing my team of six was able to get the wait time down to seven minutes. This application is currently in operation and is assisting 150+ patrons.

<p>TacticAS, a board game for Champions. Command a team of Units. Equip them as you see fit, and do battle against your friends. 2-4 players. This game is similar to HeroClix or MageKnight. It is a minitures game all in one box with one affordable price and half the hassle. Still some hassle though.
